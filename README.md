# Credit-card-fraud-detection
**Overview**

Implemented a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in an imbalanced dataset. Applied data balancing (under-sampling) and trained a Logistic Regression classifier for accurate fraud identification.

**Highlights**

Balanced highly skewed dataset (492 fraud vs ~2.8 lakh legitimate transactions).

Developed and evaluated Logistic Regression model for fraud detection.

Achieved ~94% training accuracy and ~92% testing accuracy.

Demonstrated ability to handle imbalanced datasets, apply data preprocessing, and perform binary classification.

**Tech Stack**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression

Data Processing: Sampling, Feature Engineering

 **Key Learning**

Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets in real-world scenarios.

End-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Importance of balancing accuracy with fairness in fraud detection models.
